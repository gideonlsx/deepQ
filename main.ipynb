    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model training.** The deep learning model was trained on 1,000 random 5-qubit circuits evaluated by IBMQ Burlington to predict the difference in trace distance between two equivalent random circuits. These supremacy-style random circuits had many gaps due to 2-qubit gates compensating for partial connectivity after compiling to maximum optimization; we filled the gaps completely randomly with sequences of U3 gates equivalent to the identity. All 1,000 circuits were run on IBM Q Burlington.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compiling.** We ran the trained model on a new set of 500 random circuits. For each random circuit (compiled to maximum optimization for IBM Q Burlington's error rates on March 18), we generated 1,000 randomly padded circuits. The deep learning model was then used to predict the relative noise between pairs of circuits in 50 tournaments of 20 competitors each, selecting the circuit expected to be the least noisy as the \"compiled\" circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing.** The compiled circuits were run on IBM Q Burlington, Essex, London, Ourense, Vigo (which have the same architecture) and Yorktown (which has a different architecture). On Burlington, we found that DD-compiled circuits improve trace distance by 11% (10% to 12%, 0.95 CI) per circuit compared to IBM-compiled. On all other 5-qubit devices, the DD compiler also performed better than the IBM Qiskit compiler, although with around half the improvement compared to performance on Burlington. Nevertheless, the improvement on all devices was statistically significantly better than applying random DD sequences."
